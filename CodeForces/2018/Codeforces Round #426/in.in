1 2 2 2  sum segm tree
2 2 2 1  dp k = 1

0 0 2 2  sum segm tree
4 3 2 1  dp k = 2

-several other approaches for getting max 1D array 
-kadane algo for max 1D array is acting like a dp also ! :D 
-2D max sum n^6 
-2D max sum n^4 query in O(1)
-2D max sum kadane n^3 [col .. col]
-max square sub matrix 0s and 1s 
-max rect submatrix 0s and 1s
-max sum square submatrix with size k  (stripes/sliding window)
-edit distance 
-LCS YES
